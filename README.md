## Hi there 👋

I'm Vlad Osmianski, a senior PHP + JavaScript + MySql developer of large-scale
websites & backends and entrepreneur living in Vilnius,
Lithuania 🇱🇹 with my wife Monika 👩 and a parrot Johnny 🐦.

Very good at project management and communication, too.

I’m here to create stuff that is useful to other people. Let's
keep in touch!

## I'm open for hire!

At the moment, I'm looking for a remote job. Here is [my resume](https://www.softnova.lt/resume-vlad-osmianski.pdf). 

In short, I'm experienced, motivated, affordable, team-oriented, self-disciplined, able to deep-dive into a technology of choice and get my hands dirty, and finally, the one who actually delivers.

Maybe, just maybe, I'm your next teammate. Just whisper a word to the one making hiring decisions!

**Important**. For many, hiring someone from another country or even continent may sound troublesome. Don't worry, you can make a commercial contract with the company that I own instead of actually hiring me.
