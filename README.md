## Hi there 👋

I'm Vlad Osmianski, a senior PHP + JavaScript + MySql developer of large-scale
websites & backends and entrepreneur living in Vilnius,
Lithuania 🇱🇹 with my wife Monika 👩 and a parrot Johnny 🐦.

Very good at project management and communication, too.

I’m here to create stuff that is useful to other people. Let's
keep in touch!
